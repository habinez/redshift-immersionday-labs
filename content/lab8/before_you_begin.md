## Before You Begin
This lab assumes you have launched a Redshift cluster in US-WEST-2 (Oregon), and can gather the following information. If you have not launched a cluster, see [LAB 1 - Creating Redshift Clusters](../lab1/README.md).
* [Your-Redshift_Hostname]
* [Your-Redshift_Port]
* [Your-Redshift_Username]
* [Your-Redshift_Password]
* [Your-Redshift_Role]
* [Your-AWS-Account_Id]
* [Your-Glue_Role]

It also assumes you have access to a configured client tool. For more details on configuring SQL Workbench/J as your client tool, see [Lab 1 - Creating Redshift Clusters : Configure Client Tool](../lab1/README.md#configure-client-tool). As an alternative you can use the Amazon Redshift provided online Query Editor which does not require an installation.
