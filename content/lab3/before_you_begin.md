## Before You Begin
This lab assumes you have launched a Redshift cluster, loaded it with TPC Benchmark data and can gather the following information.  If you have not launched a cluster, see [LAB 1 - Creating Redshift Clusters](../lab1/README.md).  If you have not yet loaded it, see [LAB 2 - Data Loading](../lab2/README.md).
* [Your-Redshift_Hostname]
* [Your-Redshift_Port]
* [Your-Redshift_Username]
* [Your-Redshift_Password]

It also assumes you have access to a configured client tool. For more details on configuring SQL Workbench/J as your client tool, see [Lab 1 - Creating Redshift Clusters : Configure Client Tool](../lab1/README.md#configure-client-tool). As an alternative you can use the Redshift provided online Query Editor which does not require an installation.
