This lab assumes you have launched a Redshift cluster in **US-WEST-2 (Oregon)**, and can gather the following information.  If you have not launched a cluster, see [LAB 1 - Creating Redshift Clusters](../../lab1/cloudformation).  
* [Your-Redshift_Hostname]
* [Your-Redshift_Port]
* [Your-Redshift_Username]
* [Your-Redshift_Password]
* [Your-Redshift_Role]
* [Your-AWS-Account_Id]

It also assumes you have access to a configured client tool. For more details on configuring SQL Workbench/J as your client tool, see [Lab 1 - Creating Redshift Clusters : Configure Client Tool](../../lab1/configure_client_tool). As an alternative you can use the Redshift provided online [Query Editor](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/home?#query) which does not require an installation.
