## Prerequisites
* While Amazon Redshift does provide a web-based [Query editor](https://console.aws.amazon.com/redshift/home?#query:) for executing simple queries which complete in under 3 minutes, for these labs, it is recommended you install a third-party tool.  We will use [SQL Workbench/J](http://www.sql-workbench.net).
* Once you have installed your third-party tool, you will need either a JDBC or ODBC driver.  Amazon Redshift offers JDBC and ODBC drivers for download. See [Connecting to an Amazon Redshift Cluster Using SQL Client Tools](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/connecting-to-cluster.html) from the Amazon Redshift Documentation website.
