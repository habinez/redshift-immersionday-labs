# Lab 4 - Modernize Your Data Warehouse with Amazon Redshift Spectrum

In this lab, we show you how to query petabytes of data with Amazon Redshift and exabytes of data in your Amazon S3 data lake, without loading or moving objects. We will also demonstrate how you can leverage views which union data in direct attached storage as well as in your S3 Datalake to create a single source of truth.  Finally, we will demonstrate strategies for aging off old data into S3 and maintaining only the most recent data in Amazon Redshift direct attached storage.
