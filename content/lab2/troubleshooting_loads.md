## Troubleshooting Loads
There are two Amazon Redshift system tables that can be helpful in troubleshooting data load issues:
* STL_LOAD_ERRORS
* STL_FILE_SCAN

In addition, you can validate your data without actually loading the table.  Use the NOLOAD option with the COPY command to make sure that your data file will load without any errors before running the actual data load.  Running COPY with the NOLOAD option is much faster than loading the data since it only parses the files.

Letâ€™s try to load the CUSTOMER table with a different data file with mismatched columns.  To copy this data you will need to replace the [Your-AWS_Account_Id] and [Your-Redshift_Role] values in the script below.   
```sql
COPY customer FROM 's3://redshift-immersionday-labs/data/nation/nation.tbl.'
iam_role 'arn:aws:iam::[Your-AWS_Account_Id]:role/[Your-Redshift-Role]'
region 'us-west-2' lzop delimiter '|' noload;
```

You will get the following error.
```sql
ERROR: Load into table 'customer' failed.  Check 'stl_load_errors' system table for details. [SQL State=XX000]
```

Query the STL_LOAD_ERROR system table for details.
```sql
select * from stl_load_errors;
```

You can also create a view that returns details about load errors.  The following example joins the STL_LOAD_ERRORS table to the STV_TBL_PERM table to match table IDs with actual table names.
```sql
create view loadview as
(select distinct tbl, trim(name) as table_name, query, starttime,
trim(filename) as input, line_number, colname, err_code,
trim(err_reason) as reason
from stl_load_errors sl, stv_tbl_perm sp
where sl.tbl = sp.id);

-- Query the LOADVIEW view to isolate the problem.
select * from loadview where table_name='customer';
```
